In [around April this year, I implemented a feature to invert image colors to accommodate dark mode](https://ko.puleugo.dev/190).

As someone who really loves dark mode, I wanted to create a blog environment that was optimized for it. Unfortunately, this turned out to be the blog customization I regret the most.

# The Beginning of a Disaster

I realized something was wrong when implementing the [blog tab on our club's site](https://www.megabrain.kr/blog). The problem arose where images from crawled posts couldn't be seen in White Mode due to the lack of color inversion - both the images and background were white. This led to a bizarre situation where the content became dependent on the blog's CSS.

This same problem occurs when using Cross-Platform distribution to publish the post elsewhere. Below are images distributed on the Medium platform.

When the same article is published on Medium, the images are not visible.

If you thought "Well.. I can just view it in dark mode," Medium only offers White Mode. The image on the right is a view changed to dark mode using a Google extension program called Dark Mode Reader.

Under normal circumstances, the images cannot be seen.

# Was It Better Not to Do It?

Thereâ€™s no such thing in the world. It's all part of the experience.

I need to change the color inversion CSS based on White Mode and also correct the excessively broken images.
