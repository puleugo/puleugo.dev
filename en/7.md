## What is Kaio-Ken?

Due to the recent employment recession, the average qualifications of Korean developers have improved. However, the <u>technical difficulty of overseas blogs is lower than that of Korea</u>. You can see this by looking at the [Qiita popular posts](https://qiita.com/trend), a representative tech blog platform in Japan. (As of 08/19)

* 【Complete Edition】 Master the basics of React with this one item! Beginner's tutorial!
* 【Introduction to AWS Containers】 Let's deploy a simple Python app to ECS!
* Open CSV files in Excel without 'dropping 0s' or 'characterization'
* 【Vue】Creating custom validation with VeeValidate

So I thought '**Wouldn’t there be a demand for exporting the writings of domestic developers abroad?**' The population of nine major advanced countries is approximately 44 times that of Korea, so with simple calculations, <u>your blog can gain **more than 44 times the impact**</u>. Thinking of "Kaio-Ken" from Dragon Ball, I named this project accordingly.

## Let's Design

I have been a blogger for 11 years since I was in the 4th grade of elementary school. I even experienced blog marketing in middle school and achieved a cumulative view count of 1,028k on Naver Blog. (About 10% of [Hyungro's](https://jojoldu.tistory.com/))

I am confident that I have some insights into blog-related content. From this perspective, the biggest issue is as follows.

### Issue: Google doesn’t like translated content.

**Google hates similar documents**. Even if you spend days writing an article, if the content is similar, its search result priority drops. Especially if you use the same images as well, the priority drops. All search engines prefer unique content.

Among popular posts, original content (8/10)

So what should you do?

### Solution: Specify the Alternability

The issues we worry about have likely already been adeptly handled by **previous developers**. This is the same for this case. By inserting the hreflang tag in the html head of each post, <u>it guides the post to the appropriate country and resolves the duplicate content problem</u>. (There are [other methods](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions?hl=en&visit_id=638593952115326122-859270653&rd=1) to specify this)

Add it like this and Google will handle it.

When writing a post, add the script tag in html edit mode.

```
<script>
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
    var link = document.createElement('link');
    link.rel = "alternate";
    link.hreflang = "ja";
    link.href = "https://example.com/ja";
    document.head.appendChild(link);
});
</script>
```

### Feature Implementation to My Style

* **Excel is the best for accessibility**: We will organize data through Google Sheets to manipulate it even on mobile. We will continuously synchronize Excel and DB data using CronJob.
* **Markdown is the best for scalability**: UI of HTML relies on CSS, so unintended UI results may occur. To distribute to many global blogs, we will manage it in markdown on GitHub.
* **Serverless work**: This is a task to relieve the hassle, but server management is annoying and costs are incurred. All processing will be handled with GitHub Action.

## Architecture

![](https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/dYEaUf/btsI8JHs3IP/UhtzoHZaXrAqI07gNqrrN0/img.png)

What I particularly like is that it is open to **migration to other blog platforms in the future**. So the essential features needed are as follows.

1. Tistory post md conversion
2. ChatGPT translation function
3. Implementing post upload feature for each blog platform
4. Post &harr; Excel synchronization *(ideally minimal manipulation is needed)*

We look forward to a lot of interest upon release!!
