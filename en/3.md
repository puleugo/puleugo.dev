## Introduction

* Discussing how to determine what code is worth writing unit tests for.

## What is a Valuable Test?

Merely having a lot of tests written isnâ€™t necessarily a good thing. When assembling a plastic model kit, which instruction manual would be easier to read: one that is well-organized and concise, or one packed with unnecessary details? Most would prefer the former.

Since tests are also documentation, it is much better **when they are clearly focused on the essentials**.

## What is the Value of a Test?

So, what kind of code has a **low priority for tests**? Firstly, there might be <u>overly simple logic</u>. These are understandable even without reading documentation. Secondly, objects with <u>many dependencies</u> can be exceedingly difficult to test. You might need to consider Test Doubles if you cannot use real objects, and ObjectMothers if creating those dependencies requires too many values.

Conversely, what kind of code has a **high priority for tests**? That would be <u>domain logic, code that is difficult to understand, and overly complex code</u> (an explanation on domain logic will follow in the next post).

This can be visualized as follows:

Hmm... I seem to know how to write tests for domain logic, simple code, and objects with many dependencies. But complex code, while highly valuable to test, seems difficult to test; what should I do?

This indicates that there might be an issue with the current design. The object you want to test may have too many responsibilities. (In web services, there's often a tendency to cram persistence logic, domain logic, and business logic all into a single service.)

In such cases, it's recommended to refactor by moving towards a domain model, algorithm, or simpler code in the manner shown above.

## Conclusion

* When unit testing, consider the cost-effectiveness.
* The cost-effectiveness of a test can be judged based on domain importance and code complexity.
