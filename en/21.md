## Overview

* I have worked on improving the image loading performance of the [waktaverse.games](https://waktaverse.games/) website.

## It's too slow. Please improve it.

Sanghyuk sent an inquiry email saying that the image loading speed of Waktaverse was slow.

When I expressed my interest in trying out image performance improvement to my club friends, they forwarded the email to my team.

## How slow is it?

Slow 4G: 28.54 s, Fast 4G: 5.88 s

Using the Performance feature of the Chrome Browser, I measured the performance. This can limit network/memory performance, so it is a recommended method for checking whether performance improvement is needed.

The time taken for LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) was measured.

* Slow 4G: 28.54s
* Fast 4G: 5.88s

For reference, 2.5 seconds or less is considered GOOD.

## Solution

Our team uses Cloudflare CDN. If you are using a different CDN, please refer only to what is necessary among the contents below.

### 1. Compress large images.

Common formats include png and jpg, but there are more efficient compression formats than jpg for improving web performance, such as WebP and AVIF.

Cloudflare offers a feature called [Cloudflare Polish](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/polish/) that provides a compressed version of the original image for the same image URL.

[Cloudflare Polish | Cloudflare Images docs

Cloudflare Polish is a one-click image optimization product that automatically optimizes images in your site. Polish strips metadata from images and reduces image size through lossy or lossless compression to accelerate the speed of image downloads.

### 2. Cache images already received. Use Cache-Control.

There is a problem of reloading images even when you refresh the page. At this time, you can use **HTTP response header Cache-Control**.

Cache-Control allows the browser to read the resource from the cache rather than sending a new request to the server if the validity period of the already received resource has not expired.

Fetching the resource from the cache because the resource is still present.

Slow 4G: 8.24 s, Fast 4G: 2.39 s

It was clear what needed to be done. 
If only I had known how convenient Cloudflare was, I would have worked much faster.
