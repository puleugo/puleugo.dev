## Project Introduction

Kaio-Ken is an automated translation and distribution service for blog posts. The population of major advanced countries is about 44 times that of South Korea, so even a simple calculation shows that your blog can surpass 44 times its original influence.

## Why Was It Developed?

Since I started programming, I have tried to attend lectures and study groups to gain experience from senior developers in Korea. Their common regret was that, if they had spent as much effort on learning foreign languages as they did on programming, they could have had more opportunities. They missed opportunities due to the lack of English proficiency, even when contacted by headhunters from major IT companies like Google and Facebook, and regretted not being able to showcase their skills to them.
Although it doesn't replace learning a foreign language, it's a **project that can help you easily create similar opportunities**.

> 'Kaio-Ken' is a project that amplifies the effort based on advice from seniors.

## QnA

### Can I use it for free?

Yes, you can use it through GitHub Actions.

### Could there be any costs involved?

Yes, since the translation is done via the ChatGPT API, there could be API usage fees.

### Apart from increasing views, what specific benefits can using this service bring?

We plan to monetize by inserting promotion links related to the post's topic at the bottom of the article.
Currently, we are planning partnerships with Amazon, eBay, AliExpress, ClickBank, Apple Affiliate, and Coupang Partners. However, more than financial profit, the biggest merit is exposing your projects or PR to international audiences.

### Can I contribute?

Contributions are welcome. As currently only English blogs (Medium) are supported, we recommend developing code with strategic patterns for various blogs in Japanese, Chinese, Hindi, etc.
