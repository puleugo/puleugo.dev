## Domain Logic vs. Business Logic?

Before writing code, we think about two things: **the problem to be solved** and **the solution**.

Here, the **real-world problem to be solved** is known as the **domain** (also called the Problem Domain or Core Domain), and the **solution** is referred to as **business logic** (also known as Domain Logic, Business Rule, or Domain Knowledge).

It’s easy once you know it, but without knowing, it's a confusing topic that even students find challenging.

In conclusion, **domain logic and business logic are synonyms**, and they mean the same thing as described above.

## Domain Logic

However, it would be great if the problem solution (hereafter domain logic) was the only thing in the code, but that is often not the case. Consider these examples:

* Database Logic: Saving domain models in the database
* Third-party API Logic: Using external services
* UI Logic: Code that interacts with users through the UI

There will be many such codes that are ambiguous to be called domain logic. This is particularly common when using the Transaction Script architectural pattern. *(In this pattern, services handle everything without giving actions to the domain model, mixing database logic and domain logic. It may be readable for simple code.)*

But **as the domain complexity increases, code readability tends to decrease.** A more commonly heard anti-pattern is the [Anemic Domain Model](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html). By distinguishing domain logic from other types of logic, you can extract the domain model and clearly separate concerns in the code. This reduces cognitive load required to infer what domain we are dealing with without focusing too much on details like database or UI.

Let’s extract domain logic from an application service example. **The characteristic of domain logic** can be identified by whether it involves making **decisions with business significance**. **The domain model** makes **key decisions for the business**, and **all other codes** either carry out actions based on the domain model’s decisions or provide information to facilitate the decisions.

## Separating Domain Logic from Application Service Logic

### First Example: Cash Withdrawal from an Account

```javascript
// Application Service
private TakeMoney(amount: number): void {
	if(!this.atm.canTakeMoney) {
		throw new AtmHasNotEnoughMoney('Cannot withdraw');
	}
	// Amount including commission
	const amountWithComission = this.atm.calculateAmountWithComission(amount);
	this.paymentGateway.chargePayment(amountWithComission);
	this.atm.takeMoney(amount);
	this.repository.save(this.atm);
}
```

This method is part of the application service layer. The domain class Atm **decides the amount to be charged** and provides information via .canTakeMoney(), .calculateAmountWithComission().

Afterward, the application service just listens to the decision and performs the necessary actions. It uses the paymentGateway instance to charge the amount and updates the database.

### Second Example: Message Response

```javascript
private chatMessageReceived(message: string) {
	const auctionEvent = AuctionEvent.from(message);
	const command = this.auctionSniper.process(auctionEvent);
	if (command !== AuctionCommand.None()) {
		this.chat.sendMessage(command.toString());
	}
}
```

This method is also part of the application service layer. Here, the actual domain object is AuctionSniper. **What the app service does** is converting incoming messages from the outside world into a format (AuctionEvent) that the decision-maker can understand and passes that message, proceeding based on the **decision made by the domain class**.

Neither of the code samples above makes its own decisions; they delegate everything to the domain model. This is proper concern separation. The application service layer can contain quite a bit of code, but none of it should be involved in making significant business decisions. **Only the domain model can make decisions.**

Once domain logic is extracted, the next step is to ensure that other types of logic are suitably separated (e.g., database logic).

## Summary

* Domain logic (synonymous with business logic, business rules, domain knowledge) is the logic that makes significant business decisions.
* All other types of logic (database, UI, application logic, etc.) handle the decisions made by the domain model, such as storing data, showing information to users, or communicating with external services.
* Separating domain logic from other logics is important and helps in maintaining a more comprehensible codebase overall.
