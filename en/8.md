## Reason for Participation

It looked fun. I wanted to meet new people and have some conversations.

## Preparation

Since it was my first hackathon, I wanted to prepare boilerplate code for smooth collaboration. During this time, I also wrote an article titled "The Ideal Developer's Hackathon Preparation Method," and spent almost a week preparing for the hackathon.

People were quite shy. A Discord server was created a week before the event for communication, but no one chatted, including introductions. So to lighten the mood, I wrote a long introduction about myself.

Please.. give me a heart..

Having experience organizing hackathons, I wrote in a more engaging manner thinking of the hardworking GDSC organizers.

## Team Matching

The GDSC organizers handled the team matching. Although it was random, all participants were great, so it was fun.

Our team had three backend developers: me, Min-joo [Velog Link](https://velog.io/@kirby0418/posts), and Yoon-jeong, thus we proceeded with Java due to our team setup. (Min-joo led the frontend, and I couldn't use the Node.js boilerplate code I prepared.)

Including our core member Seong-hyeon, who took on the roles of designer, PPT creator, and planner, we were a team of four.

## Topic and Planning

The theme was to create a product that meets one of the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals. (Personally, having multiple topics made planning challenging.) Everyone had a solution in mind, but there was no unanimous decision.

Everyone had experience in planning or startups, so there were strict criteria:

- Solve problems that resonate with participants
- Create a product that **I** would use

With 10 minutes remaining, we finally settled on a highly satisfactory plan: developing a **used book exchange service**.

The flow displayed during the plan presentation

The planned presentation had a 2-minute limit, and our team presented using 2-3 slides.

## During the Hackathon

My goals for this hackathon were to 'meet many good people' and have 'fun experiences'. I achieved both, making it a very positive experience.

To meet many good people, I completed my assigned tasks and then spent about 10 minutes chatting with other participants. I think I talked with about **half of the teams**. It was a lot of fun. Walking together with teammates multiple times, we shared experiences and worries, which brought us closer.

## Thank You, Wactaverse..

Although I am not usually an extrovert, I think I had a lot of conversations at this hackathon. I realized that mentioning I was working on something related to Wactaverse made it easier for others to remember me. It was amusing to see mentors explaining Wactaverse to each other.

## Presentation

In technical high school, I never imagined I would be presenting at KAIST three years later..

During the presentation, I focused on what would make a lasting impression on people. While the idea was good-spirited, focusing solely on the product might edge us too closely to existing used goods platforms like **Carrot Market**.

I started differently from others, making it participatory from the beginning.

### First Quiz

1. You're sleepy from staying up all night, aren't you? To keep things interesting, I've prepared a quiz! (Brief introduction to grab attention)
2. Do you know what April 4th is? (A question most would not know)
3. ...
4. It is the day we use no paper. April 14th is Black Day, a day for eating black bean noodles, yet no one knows about this. I wanted to highlight that there's **little interest in paper**...

### Second Quiz

1. Now here's a question everyone can answer easily (change of topic)
2. What's humanity's greatest invention, in your opinion?
3. Air conditioning, gunpowder, automobiles, books, etc.
4. All are correct. However, all of these inventions aid human activities, while **only books assist human memory**. Yet, donâ€™t we have such **books piling up at home, unused?**

Following this was the explanation of the product...

While participant feedback on our presentation was positive, since 90% of the evaluation considered the judges' and mentors' perspectives, I felt a different format might have been better.

## Reflections

It was lots of fun, so I am very satisfied.. *(Next time, I will prepare a Java boilerplate as well..)*
