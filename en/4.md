## Introduction

Tistory by default ignores margins included in CSS, which leads many bloggers to excessively press enter for line breaks, making the content less readable. In this post, we will remove the CSS property `tt_article_useless_p_margin` which eliminates margins.

## Problem Analysis

Upon roughly examining the network and operational flow, it goes like this:

1. Call the post API (text/html).
2. Call the `useLessPMargin.css` API.
3. Load the HTML and CSS provided by Tistory.
4. Mount the CSSOM.
5. Mount the DOM.

## Method

Using jQuery, we removed the `tt_article_useless_p_margin` class that was ultimately added to the CSSOM during DOM mount.

```html
<body>
    <!-- ... Existing blog code -->

    <!-- jQuery installation -->
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
    <!-- Remove the CSS that deletes the margins arbitrarily -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
        $("div").removeClass("tt_article_useless_p_margin")
    </script>
</body>
```
