## Introduction

I am participating in Sparklingthon hosted by [KAIST GDSC](https://gdsc-kaist.github.io/). Although I have experience hosting two hackathons at my alma mater, this is my first time fully participating as a participant, so I have high expectations. As someone with experience hosting hackathons, I would like to talk about the ideal preparation for developers.

While collaboration is very important, even more so than development skills, I have so much to say about development alone that I'll save the collaboration topic for another time.

## Ideal Hackathon Participants

A hackathon should be aimed more at <u>fun, enhancing collaboration skills, and enjoying free pizza and soda</u>, rather than building credentials. If you're participating in a hackathon to experience handling <u>large traffic and scalability, you may not be viewed as a very good team member</u>.

So, what kind of developer makes a good hackathon team member? Someone who does not need others to depend on them. Here are the roles recruited for this hackathon. (4 people per team)

The nodes are roles, the edges are dependencies. Consider the saturation as dependency levels. Given the many variables within a hackathon, this graph isn't absolute.

Let's think about <u>what to focus on from a backend developer's perspective</u>.

* When collaborating with <u>planners</u>, thoroughly understanding the problems to solve and the solutions is vital. This requires a lot of communication to ensure clear understanding. Keep in mind that the dependency of the development department is entirely directed towards you.
* When working with <u>designers</u>, continuously consider what information you need to provide for the frontend based on the UI, and what information is needed according to the user's story. Decide whether certain algorithms need to be processed on the server or on the frontend based on the design in subsequent meetings.
* When collaborating with <u>frontend developers</u>, **provide APIs quickly**. They handle the most user-facing tasks, so if there's a delay in API provision, the frontend developers' workload increases.

Everyone may end up mentally exhausted from working all night. I've seen quite a few teams get into fights during hackathons, so being a good team member is crucial to prevent this. Ultimately, hackathons exist because <u>everyone participates to have fun and be happy</u>.

## Prepare This if You're in Backend

First, prepare a **boilerplate**. A boilerplate is <u>repeated code that can be used immediately without much change</u>. This will be helpful not only to you but also to the <u>frontend developers</u>. For instance:

1. API documentation (e.g., Swagger)
2. DB setup and ORM
3. Deployed AWS, S3 containers: It’s inadvisable for frontend to clone the server and work locally.
4. <u>E2E testing</u>: Writing unit and integration tests in advance is almost meaningless as they will change once the planning comes out. During the hackathon, conduct tests other than E2E only after development is complete.
5. Quick extension of 3rd Party using Docker Compose
6. Automated server deployment
7. Post creation
8. File uploads
9. Chat functionality
10. ~~Authentication~~: Don’t add unless needed. Unless it is a security hackathon, it can only slow down project development.

The reason for emphasizing <u>E2E testing is to demonstrate your reliability</u>. In a hackathon, you are not only under pressure and excited, but also experiencing various emotions. In such situations, <u>even small mistakes can feel significant</u>.

E2E tests will verify this. Test parts observable by frontend developers, such as Swagger deployment and API operation confirmation. Writing tests beforehand will reduce mistakes, such as forgetting constraints or team-agreed solutions, as we are creatures of forgetfulness.

Secondly, try using **open-source and external APIs**. Sometimes resolving a hackathon problem isn’t just about the solution. "Data" or "complex algorithms" might be necessary, which open-source and external APIs can provide. This is a topic consistently covered in Kakao's Goormthon education.

Reading usage instructions is also a cost. It’s advisable to experiment with them once before the hackathon.

For data references, consider the following:

* [Korean Public Data](https://www.data.go.kr/)
* [Global Public Data](https://opendatainception.io/)
* [Data.gov](https://data.gov/): The U.S. government’s public data portal, offering data in categories like economy, environment, and education.
* [awesome-public-datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)

For external APIs, consider these references:

* [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/hub)
* [Public API](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
* [API Layer](https://apilayer.com/)
* [ChatGPT API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)

If you’re using Node.js frameworks, consider using Nest.js, which is effective for managing boilerplate additional features by module-based dependency management.

Thirdly, develop the project with the mindset of creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

Correct MVP

When creating an MVP for a car, don’t start with a bicycle—ensure at least a basic car implementation.

1. In case 1, cooperation is impossible until reaching step 4.
2. In case 2, understand the function you are trying to build. If it is transportation, step 1 suffices. If it is a car, make step 4 right away.
3. In case 3, the goal—a car—was built right from step 1.

Case 3 is the MVP. Many developers mistake case 2 for MVP, but an MVP is a <u>minimum function</u> product. Why develop minimum functions in several separate steps? Aim directly to build a prototype. MVPs are less likely to change.

The more important point is that at step 4 it works securely, but from steps 1-3, it does not need to work perfectly. Quickly provide the appropriate result (e.g., json) to the frontend to keep development going. Frontend developers should also build the UI before server API processing parts.

Fourth, consider Git versioning strategy. Most developers use Git Flow; however, for fast-paced hackathons, I recommend the GitHub Flow strategy. Compared to Git Flow, suitable for large teams, GitHub Flow is ideal for small teams of around 1-3 people.

<u>GitHub Flow manages with a Main branch + n feature branches</u>. It results in much quicker development than Git Flow, which involves operation-related branches.
