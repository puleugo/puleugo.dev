## The Long and Arduous Journey to the Beta Release

1389 commits per day

This project was quite challenging. It had been a while since I started a new project and began working with only abstract plans, so there were many instances where I took a long detour during the concretization process. I'll summarize the most representative of these.

## 1. Translation Post Link Dependent on Platform?

The method I originally thought of, uploading a translated post and then modifying the content using a JS Injection link method, had many issues.

First, there's the problem that <u>the post content needs to be modified</u>. Most blog platforms (Medium, Dev.to, Qiita, Tistory) do not support post modification through their APIs, and even if they do, they often block JS Injection. 
Although I managed to implement post modification by analyzing Tistory's API and using reverse engineering through HTTP communication only, this was <u>too difficult</u>. In fact, I gave up when I saw that Medium uses GraphQL communication.

I decided to abandon this method and look for another way.

### Fortunately, Linking is Possible Through a Sitemap.

When you read "[Informing Google About Translated Versions of Pages](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions?hl=en&visit_id=638593952115326122-859270653&rd=1)", there are other methods too:

1. ~~Attached to HTML tag.~~ (Failed)
2. ~~Attached to HTTP Header.~~ (I couldn't think of a way to manipulate the platform's response, so I skipped it)
3. Specify in the Sitemap. ‚Üê Let's explore this friend.

A Sitemap is a file provided to inform Google crawlers about the relationships of the site's pages, videos, and other files. It can provide information like:

* <u>Link to the translation</u>
* The last modification date of the post, title, priority

It's a very interesting file. Even Tistory provides it.

The question then becomes 'How do we modify Tistory's Sitemap?' Wait... no. The question is '<u>How do I write my blog's Sitemap to provide to Google?</u>' 
After redefining the problem, I thought of '<u>issuing a personal domain to connect with the blog</u>'. With a personal domain, I could modify the Sitemap freely. This was the correct answer.

I utilized Vercel to connect the sitemap.xml uploaded to the GitHub repository with the domain. This way, I could work with Free + Serverless + File System! (It takes about 5 minutes to set up.)

## 2. Too Many External Dependencies

This project has many external dependencies relative to its size. To simply list them:

* Spread Sheet: Input information about the blog
* GitHub: Original & translation posts, Metadata file for integrity verification, Sitemap file
* GitHub Action: Free execution environment
* ChatGPT: The guy who's good at English
* Vercel: Free Sitemap launcher
* Blog Platforms:
  * Tistory: GOAT of Google search
  * Medium: GOAT of English development platforms

In other words, testing is incredibly tough. GitHub is famously relaxed, so I worked without creating a Stub. However, when Medium threw a 429 error due to exceeding the daily usage limit, I realized a Test Double is urgently needed. Once the beta release is done, I'll try to make the project more robust with test codes.

## 3. Things I Always Regret but Aren't Habituated (Weaknesses to Fix)

1. Run more simulations before coding
2. For new tasks, look for various methods and think of the most efficient one.
   * I think the Tistory RE was a very brute method. (Not even sure if it was reverse engineering.)
3. Write tests to the end.
   * If it's hard to write tests, I again realized it means the responsibility division is wrong.

## In Conclusion

I'll release the beta version by tomorrow. Once the beta release is finished, I'll have to start preparing for my career in earnest... haha.
